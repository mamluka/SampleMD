<test version   =  "0.1">
<preamble>A small file exercising all the features
          in the parser...
</preamble>

<title>Mary had a &lt;little&gt; lamb who liked standard entities</title>

<text>This is some text, with character references (&#x4F; &#87;)
and some cdata sections inside to make it more interesting. How about this
<![CDATA[ 
                   <begin> 
                    pepe 
                   </end> ]]>    ?
</text>

<single what="An 'empty' tag" />

<misc disposition="throw_away" 
         other_att = 'single quotes to enclose "Oh!"...'  >
In the next pcdata chunk there is an unknown entity
1.24 &notknown;3.45
(It was flagged, but the parser continued)

In the following chunk there is a character reference out of range of the
char() intrinsic... remove it from test.xml if it gives you trouble.

Offending reference: &#3456;
